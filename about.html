        <div class="ab2">
            We are a community of skillful hackers, security researchers <br>and problem solvers.<br><br><br>
            We have spent countless hours honing our skills and<br> pushing the limits of what is possible in the<br> world of information security.<br><br><br>
            We believe that hacking is not just a profession,<br> but a way of life.<br><br><br>
            As members of the Sacred Order of Shell, we are<br> not just friends and teammates, but also rivals.<br><br><br>
            We believe in healthy competition and constantly strive <br>to improve our skills and knowledge by taking part in various <br>CTF competitions. We are passionate about what we do and are always <br>looking for new ways to push the boundaries of what is possible in the world of security.
